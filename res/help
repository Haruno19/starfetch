starfetch is a command line tool that displays information about a constellation alongside its scheme.

Usage: starfetch [OPTION] [CONSTELLATION NAME]
    -h      Prints this help message.
    -n      Shows the selected constellation.
    -r      Shows a random constellation.
    -l      Prints the list of all the available constellations.
    
If launched with no arguments, the behaviour is the same as with '-r'.

Examples:   starfetch -r
            starfetch -n orion
            starfetch
